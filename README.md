- Hi, I’m @snikpohw
- I’m currently learning aspects of Deep Learning via fast.ai's course.
- In addition, I intend to work through Robert Osazuwa Ness' Causal AI book when it becomes available, in
  furthering my interest in applying causal inference to engineering problems (I took a related course from Robert via
  his Altdeep.ai site).
